For networking mode, firstly run `ServMain.java` to open a server. Then run an arbitrary number of `ClntMain.java` as clients.

For normal mode, just run `Main.java`.

Notice that `AutoBullet` is not supported in networking mode yet (at least I didn't tested). To change it, go to `Weapons.java`, comment out line 112 and uncomment line 113.
